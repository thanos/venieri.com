  <h3>Artist's Statement</h3>

<p>Two hundred years ago, at the beginning of industrial revolution, passed the comet, Byron. The poet who made revolution a la mode, who inspired among others Verdi, Delacroix, Goethe, Dumas, Nietzsche, Dostoyevsky, Pushkin, Géricault, Poe and the rest of humanity. They adopted his brave altruistic spirit, which was fertilized by his courage and with his early death.
</p>
<p>When the Byronic Big Bang exploded, the world was filled with extraordinary heroes with humanitarian momentum which continues to our days: vampires chained by their oaths, female Allegories, melancholic pirates and possessed poets.
</p> 
<p>Always in love, totally epic, secretly romantic, dying in magic faraway lands under the spell of tyrannical despots, tired from the eternity of the past, the Byronic Heroes dream a legend of freedom and love in which they will be immortalized in a poem, a painting or a song.
