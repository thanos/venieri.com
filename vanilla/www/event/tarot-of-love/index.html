    <p><span class="leader">The new exhibition of Lydia Venieri heralds the launch of i-D ProjectArt, a new dynamic presence 
  in the art scene of Athens.  The exhibition of the renowned Greek artist, who lives 
  and works in New York City, is called Tarots of Love and is curated by Maria Xanthakos.</span> </p>
  
  It opened on May 22, 2017 and was celebrated with the presence of the artist, who come to Greece especially for the opening event.


<p>Lydia Venieri was inspired by the enduring magic of love and created a series of works capturing the diversity of emotions. She deciphers her “cards” by using our subconscious and leading us to obscure paths of our soul. Her symbols mysteriously get connected with the origin of the tarots cards and her colorful figures unite the material and the spiritual world. Her unique vision plays games with our inner self by creating opposite feelings and leads us to a higher inner degree.
</p>
<h2>The form of intelligence is love.</h2>

<p>Love is the common interest, the compression, the participation, care, beauty and health.
</p>
<p>Art holds the key of perception initiating the beings into the unseen world through the senses. Every human is the factor of invisible power which defines them and their trajectory and finally their life.
</p>
<p>The ancient gods, the calling (martyrdom ) of the saints and  the zodiac signs carry the meaning of these powers which the feelings are the most simple form of expression.
</p>
<p>We all have inside us these powers as we are all puppets with  invisible strings but in our inside microcosm these divinities reflect in our face: From the most beautiful to the most ugly, from the most intelligent to the most stupid, from the most generous to the most mean and if it is the heroic self who protects the terrified one who else will do it?
</p>
<p>The tarot of unseen power puts in order the thoughts, cleans up 
  the horizon and studies the power which defines the destiny, targets and 
  facilitates the communication with the highest (sublime) self.
