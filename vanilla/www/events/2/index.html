In their contrasts, we find the commonality of the gaze.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The eyes are both windows and shutters to the soul. In observing each other and ourselves, the eyes allow \r\n  us to construct the photographic storyline of our past and present. We visualize the future while witnessing \r\n  the present. Optical perception immediately becomes memory. How we perceive warps what we see and how we \r\n  remember.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EYES ONLY features work by <b>ORLAN</b> from her Re-Figuration / Self-Hybridization Pre-Columbian series. \r\n  Her foray into the infinite permutations of the self is an enduring feminist commentary on rituals \r\n  and expectations of beautification. <b>Halim al Karim</b> isolates the eyes to expose the stark reality of the \r\n  devastating wars in the Middle East, pushing the viewer to empathize and reflect upon the witnesses of \r\n  tragedy. <b>Josef Fischnaller</b> playfully recycles historical portraiture, photographing the present looking \r\n  into the past, making us smile in recognition of this continuum. <b>Ruud Van Empel</b> digitally paints with \r\n  photographs often creating composite adolescents with the eyes of many, allowing us to observe an invented \r\n  psychosocial humanity, critiquing representations of adolescence, race, and gender. <b>Lydia Venieri</b> harnesses the \r\n  reflective eye itself to reveal the lingering effects of trauma and calamity upon the societal psyche, \r\n  resurrecting images of tragedy that the world might rather enshroud in secrecy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The eyes in these photographs are piercing, calming, deceptive, unnerving, and revelatory. Each of these \r\n  artists utilize the gaze to strip away farce and force the viewer to confront the subject, creating art \r\n  <b>FOR THE EYES ONLY</b> of those who wish to travel between the world and the mind, to delve into the \r\n  societal secrets held within the gaze.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n </div>", "eventSchedule": {"@type": "Schedule", "endDate": "2015-06-06", "startDate": "2015-04-29"}, "location": "STUX + HALLER GALLERY", "name": "EYES ONLY", "url": "/event/eyes-only"}</script>

From the Paleolithic to our days, animals accompany without \r\n    stopping the aesthetic representation of the world as man conceives and arranges it for himself. Sacred \r\n    ibis of Pharaohs' Egypt, winged listeners of Saint Francis of Assisi and other Cock of Brancusi ... The bird, an eminent member of the animal kingdom, enjoys a place of choice in the territory of forms inspired by this last. The animalisation of the artistic expression in which he participates is the indicator of a homage but also of a strategy. The bird, in this part, plays a role both cognitive and symbolic. By watching him live, by appropriating his image or his feathers, the man specifies his own position within the living, by consolidating his domination.\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>The use that contemporary artists make of the bird is in the image of contemporary art itself: diverse, \r\n    diffracted, multiform, open. Far from the stereotypes traditionally attached to his figure (freedom, \r\n    lightness, travel, romance), the convocation of the bird comes to serve the more general ambition of \r\n    today's artists: to probe the essence of the living in biological, ecological matter and politics.</p>\r\n\r\n  <a href=\"http://paul.ardenne-loiseau.s3.amazonaws.com/Loiseau_vole.pdf\">http://paul.ardenne-loiseau.s3.amazonaws.com/Loiseau_vole.pdf</a>\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n<p>On the occasion of the exhibition, the Museum of Hunting and Nature of Paris is hosting the 19th session of \r\nVIDEO FOREVER (3 September 2014, 7.30 pm) on the theme of Birds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How to explain my love of birds? People have asked me so often to justify this love. What can I say?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I love, that's all there is to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul Ardenne</p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n<p>The Greek origin of Lydia Vernieri is not for nothing in the cult of nature that runs throughout her work. Rocked by \r\nmythology, medieval chemistry and Mediterranean orthodoxy, she writes with incredible passages the themes of \r\nthe world. Exile, nomadism and migration by constantly going back and forth between these different references. \r\nWith Human Bird, the artist gives us a view of the world through the eyes of this caged bird. Because it is the \r\nhuman, seems to question Lydia Vernieri, sibylline, if it is also a caged animal - even if this cage seems to obey \r\na poeÌ Singular and more like an arch than a prison, an arch inhabited by a harmoniousfloral composition but in \r\nwhich â \"Human Bird\" is caught by the glass walls? Human Bird: an ambiguous meÌ tapress of a world \r\nappearing to us without borders, but which, in reality, limits us and encloses us in a delicious comfort. The \r\nartist here, more than the bird, \"vole\" the same concept of a cage to lock us in. The alternative? \r\nMigration \"but who, today, chooses migration without being constrained?\"</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Lydia Venieri's Greek origins are one explanation of the cult of nature evidenced throughout her work. Steeped in \r\nmythology, medieval alchemy and Mediterranean Orthodox religion, she works ingeniously with the themes of exile, \r\nnomadism and migration, moving constantly between these different references. In Human Bird the artist shows the \r\nworld through the eyes of a bird. Ventrei seems to be hinting, in sibylline fashion, that humanity, too, is a \r\ncaged animal, even if the cage here seems to reflect a singular poetics, being more like an ark than a prison, \r\nan ark inhabited by a harmonious floral composition in which the \"Human Bird\" is caught in a trap of \r\nglass. Human Bird: an ambiguous metaphor for a world that we do not want to see, but in reality, in reality, \r\nlimits us and encloses us in a licious comfort. Here the artist \"steals\" the concept of not only the \r\nbird but also the cage, the cage in which she con fi nes us. The alternative? Migration. But who, nowadays, \r\nchooses migration a less they are forced to?</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n </div>", "eventSchedule": {"@type": "Schedule", "endDate": "2014-10-18", "startDate": "2014-09-06"}, "location": "Analix Forever Gallery and Vanessa Quang Gallery", "name": "The Stolen Bird", "url": "/event/the-stolen-bird"}</script>

Fire's amphibious capacity to both transform \r\n  physical material and participate in the art's abstract content is thoroughly discussed.\r\n \r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\nFire is perhaps the most dynamic and elusive of the four elements in classical thought. Although \r\n  immaterial, fire curiously embodies a bright, defined presence, and its vaporizing power grants \r\n  it a peculiarly intimate relationship with tangible matter. It sustains light and warmth, but can \r\n  also sponsor demolition and ashen death from which hope (or further despair) could arise. \r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\nFire's capacity to be both simplifying and sublimating is fluently, metaphorically articulated by a \r\n  number of participating artists, by the production of visual art, where the flame is frequently\r\n  employed as subject, medium and vehicle for alchemy. Sokari Douglas Camp, Kathy Ruttenberg, \r\n  Dana Melamed, and Michael Zanskyliterally domesticate fire's destructive ability to delicately tweak steel, \r\n  wood or paper, and solidify wet earth, while Rúrí's Burning Rainbow depicts a mesmerizing, \r\n  near-tangible impossibility. In addition, the show will include a video of \"the father\" of \r\n  fire in art, an Yves Klein dynamic performance that directly enlists both fire and the raw human body\r\n  for the creation of art.   \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n </div>", "eventSchedule": {"@type": "Schedule", "endDate": "2014-07-31", "startDate": "2014-07-05"}, "location": "Stux Gallery, New York", "name": "...Burning Bright: Tiger, Tiger", "url": "/event/burning-bright-tiger-tiger"}</script>
