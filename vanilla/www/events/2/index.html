Romance and suspense combine to create a tantalizing comedy. As the twists and surprises grow, no one—not him, not her, not the audience—can be sure of the truth. The play becomes an investigation of illusion, reality, and the nature of love. Love. Waltz with Eros is a story of love, trust, and how we deal with second-chances. A story of lies, theft, and the death of dreams, which is to say it is the story of ordinary life. He is a conscientious, manipulative ‘gentleman’, a con man with a history of lies who preys on single women. One day, by chance or as fate would have it, he meets his match. She is a lonely woman of routine, self doubt, and repressed fantasies. Neither of them think that they are deserving of love – hence the deception and the attraction.  Can love—or even trust—bloom between these two deeply scarred specimens? Love. Waltz with Eros is a study, in bold contrast, of two voices parleying points of view: the pragmatic vs. the fantastic, the mundane vs. the extravagant, truth vs. illusion. It’s a thin line between love and hate. Love. You can’t live with it. You can’t live without it.", "eventSchedule": {"@type": "Schedule", "endDate": null, "startDate": "2015-12-13"}, "location": "Stathakion Theatre, New york", "name": "LOVE - WALTZ WITH EROS - ΒΑΛΣ ΜΕ ΤΟΝ ΈΡΩΤΑ", "url": "/event/love-waltz-with-eros-bals-me-ton-erota"}</script>
