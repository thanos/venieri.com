Yuri, a mad scientist, attempts to awaken the human conscience. He imagines a Sleeping Beauty Conscience imprisoned at the deepest level of Universal Sleep. He decides to force people into deep hibernation and then steal their dreams.

He cultivates mythological beings: Humans crossbred with everlasting plants. His dream compressor brings dreams from the immaterial world into our dimension.

Yuri is a contemporary anti-hero: His puritanical
ideas spring form the fear of degeneration. As in an ancient tragedy the heroes address the public. Speaking their thoughts and developing the philosophy of their
acts.

appears announcing that Yuri has been awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace. Like in a modern commedia dell&#x27;Arte the End is postponed.
